## Protocol Support Information

The system supports two GPS tracking protocols:

### Traditional 808 Protocol
- Text-based protocol with command codes like BP01 (login), BP02 (GPS), etc.
- Message format: `##,imei:IMEI,command,timestamp,device_id,...*checksum##`
- Simpler string-based format popular with many basic GPS trackers

### JT/T 808 Protocol
- Chinese national standard for GPS communication (JT/T 808-2011/2013/2019)
- Binary protocol with message IDs like 0x0100 (registration), 0x0200 (location)
- More structured binary format with proper bit fields and BCD time encoding
- Enhanced features like terminal authentication, registration, and extended data

Both protocols are automatically detected by the server, allowing mixed device support.
