’m working on a Vue-based PetTracker app, specifically on the “Edit Device” screen. Currently, there’s a placeholder in the Device ID field that reads:

java
Copy
Enter 10-digit device ID (e.g., JT12345678)
Why It’s a Problem:

Placeholder Limitations: The instructions disappear as soon as the user starts typing, leaving them without guidance if they forget the required format.

Accessibility Concerns: Screen readers and assistive technologies may not consistently announce placeholder text, making it less reliable for important instructions.

Desired Improvements:

Visible Label or Helper Text

Rather than relying on a placeholder, display a label (e.g., “Device ID (10 characters, letters and numbers)”) so the requirements remain visible at all times.

Optionally add a small helper text under the input (e.g., “Letters and numbers only. Example: JT12345678”) that doesn’t vanish on typing.

Optional Tooltip or Icon

If more explanation is needed, consider a tooltip icon next to the label (a small “?” or “i” icon) that, when hovered or tapped, shows additional instructions.

Validation & Feedback

Include real-time validation or show an error message if the user’s input doesn’t match the 10-character requirement. This prevents confusion once the user moves away from the field.

Code Snippets & Accessibility

Provide Vue code examples demonstrating how to implement a persistent label with helper text instead of using a placeholder.

Show how to include ARIA attributes or descriptive text for screen readers if necessary.

Deliverables:

Updated DeviceForm.vue snippet (or a shared form component) that shows the new label, helper text, or tooltip approach.

Explanations or code references for adding real-time validation feedback (e.g., using a v-if="errorMessage" under the input).

Any required changes to CSS/SCSS to style the helper text or tooltip consistently with the existing design.

The goal is to provide a better user experience where the required format is always visible or easily discoverable, enhancing both clarity and accessibility compared to a placeholder that disappears.
