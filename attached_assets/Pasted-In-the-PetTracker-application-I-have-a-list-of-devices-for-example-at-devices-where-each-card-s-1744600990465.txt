In the PetTracker application, I have a list of devices (for example, at /devices) where each card shows whether or not the device is assigned to a pet. Right now, the UI shows “Not assigned” even though the database confirms that a pet is associated with that device (and the edit screen also shows the correct pet assignment).

Problem:

The devices are actually assigned to pets in the DB, but the list view incorrectly displays “Not assigned.”

When I open the edit form for a device, the correct pet is displayed.

What I Need:

Front-End Review:

Check how the device listing component (e.g., Devices.vue or a similar file) retrieves and displays the pet assignment. Verify if the API response includes the pet_id (or pet object) and ensure that the UI code handles it correctly.

Confirm that there is no mismatch in property names (e.g., if the backend returns assigned_pet but the front-end uses pet).

Back-End Verification:

Make sure the endpoint responsible for listing devices (e.g., GET /api/devices/) includes the pet relationship. If the pet relationship is not eager-loaded or included in the JSON response, the front-end will have no data about pet assignments.

Verify that pet_id or the full pet object is included in the device serializer or response.

UI Fix:

Update the device list UI to display the name of the assigned pet if pet_id or a pet object is returned. For instance, show "Assigned to: Buddy" instead of “Not assigned.”

Provide fallback text (like “Not assigned”) only if pet_id is null (or if there is no pet object).

Deliverables:

Code snippets showing how the updated API response handles the pet relationship in the device list.

Front-end changes (e.g., in Devices.vue) that properly display the assigned pet’s name instead of showing “Not assigned.”

Any additional notes on how to keep the device edit view consistent with the list view.

Goal:
Get the device list page to correctly show the assigned pet’s name whenever a pet is associated with the device in the database, so that the user sees consistent information between the list page and the edit page.
